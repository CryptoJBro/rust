# Rust Examples
These are examples of Rust code as I learn it. I hope the comments are educational and helpful. This file is also a pep talk to myself so I keep going!

It is taking patience and consistency to learn Rust. Keep at it and don't ever give up. Focus on building something specific that aligns with your interests. This will keep you interested and focused.

Break up the program you want to create into the small problems that need to be solved. For example, I want to make programs that interact with various blockchains for DeFi.

## The parts would be:
make a websocket or http client,
connect to the network,
make sure my crypto wallet is interacting,
serialize and deserialize between JSON and text,
learn the commands that the network needs,
send commands,
test on testnets first
